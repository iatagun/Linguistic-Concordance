# Linguistic-Concordance
Concordance is a Python library for generating concordances from text files. A concordance is a list of words that appear in a text, along with the context in which they appear. Concordances are often used in linguistic analysis to study the usage and meaning of words in a particular text or corpus.


# Installation
To install Concordance, you can use pip:

```python

from concordance import conc2csv
conc2csv('test.txt', 'bir', 4)

```
This will generate a concordance for the word "bir" in the file "test.txt", showing the 4 words of context on either side of each occurrence of the word.
